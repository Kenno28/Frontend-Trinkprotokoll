### Welcome

Here is the frontend for my university project in web engineering. It focuses on logging and viewing the drinking habits of other patients. Administrators have the ability to add, delete, or edit patients in the system, while nurses can edit patient data.

Here I mainly use TypeScript, React and CSS
